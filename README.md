A Computational Model of the Human Brain: A Dual-DNN Framework for Cognitive Simulation
DualDNN-Brain
A Dual-Hemisphere Deep Neural Network (DNN) Inspired by Human Cognition

Description
This project introduces a bio-inspired AI brain model, simulating the left and right hemispheres of the human brain using a dual-DNN structure. A third central DNN (CC-DNN) acts as a mediator, mimicking the corpus callosum to integrate emotional and rational decision-making. The model naturally exhibits cognitive biases, introspection, and subconscious-like processing, making it a major step toward AI with human-like thought patterns.

Key Features
ðŸ§  Dual-Hemisphere AI â€“ Right DNN for emotions, Left DNN for logic, Central DNN for integration.
ðŸŽ­ Inner Voice Simulation â€“ Generates self-dialogue and cognitive conflict.
ðŸŽ¯ Cognitive Bias Modeling â€“ AI learns anchoring bias, confirmation bias, and emotional memory effects.
âš– Emotion vs. Logic Weighing â€“ Dynamically balances rationality and intuition.
ðŸ”¬ Inspired by Neuroscience & Psychology â€“ Based on theories from Kahneman, Gazzaniga, Damasio, and Freud.
